Digital Rupees is inspired by Bitcoin and enhancements done by amazing developers of PPCoin & Novacoin
By no means anything made by a man is Perfect but developers try their best to find problems and remove them 
This project at this moment is stable. More developers are welcome to join and carry the development forward
and enhance it. 

DigitalRs started as just a learning project and a door opener from Pakistan. It aims to be an open community 
project with no centralized control. Its a dream for some and hopefully one day it can achieve those dreams.
Thanks go to Basit Alvi of Brain Telecommunications Pvt Ltd, Pakistan for his efforts and contribution.

This project will not be anything without openness and a strong community. I would like this oppertunity to
request all of the supporters to visit www.ipfire.org and check the outstanding work done by the IPFire team.
It is a free appliance to secure and segment your network. DigitalRs has allocated 5 Million DRS for IPFire
donation and to support its community based development. 

Thank you for reading and best of luck!
