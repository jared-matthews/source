Digital Rupees is inspired by Bitcoin and enhancements done by amazing developers of PPCoin & Novacoin
By no means anything made by a man is Perfect but developers try their best to find problems and remove them 
This project at this moment is stable and support from few developers. More developers are welcome to join and
carry the development forward and enhance it. 

DigitalRs started as just a learning project and a door opener from Pakistan. It aims to be an open community 
project with no centralized control. Its a dream for some and hopefully one day it can achieve those dreams.
Thanks go to Basit Alvi of Brain Telecommunications Pvt Ltd, Pakistan for his efforts and contribution.

This project will not be anything without open-ness and a strong community.
