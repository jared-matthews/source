FREEBSD BUILD NOTES
===================
DigitalRs Daemon was tested on FreeBSD 10.3 and is bit tricky. It needs patience as build <br/>
takes time. You need to build from sources. Start off with: <br/>
<br/>
freebsd-update fetch <br/>
freebsd-update install <br/>
portsnap update fetch <br/>
portsnap extract <br/>
<br/>
After FreeBSD and its ports are available, navigate to /usr/ports and build: <br/>
<br/>
devel/git <br/>
devel/boost-all <br/>
devel/gmake <br/>
databases/db48 <br/>
<br/>
Don't forget to do a make clean after make install <br/>
Set your proper flags for Compiler option in makefile and simply run <br/>
gmake -f makefile.unix
<br/>
Relocate the binary to appropirate patch and create conf with 600 permission.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!
