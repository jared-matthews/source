FREEBSD BUILD NOTES
===================
DigitalRs Daemon was tested on FreeBSD 10.3 and is bit tricky. It needs patience as build
takes time. You need to build from sources. Start off with:

freebsd-update fetch 
freebsd-update install 
portsnap update fetch ( always good to update before you start )
portsnap extract

After FreeBSD and its ports are available, navigate to /usr/ports and build: 

devel/git 
devel/boost-all 
devel/gmake 
databases/db48

Don't forget to do a make clean after make install.

Set your proper flags for Compiler option in makefile and simply run
gmake -f makefile.unix

Relocate the binary to appropirate path and create conf with 600 permission.

Good Luck!
